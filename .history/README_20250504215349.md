Introduction to Our Mobile App – UTM Mood Tracker

Developed by Team Upholders, the UTM Mood Tracker is a mobile application designed to support the emotional wellbeing of the UTM community. This app provides a secure and user-friendly platform for students to log their moods, reflect on their mental health, and gain meaningful insights over time.

The system supports three key user roles:

Students, who track their moods and journal their thoughts

Therapists, who can access student mood data with consent for better guidance

Admins, who manage user access and oversee system integrity

With features like voice-based journaling, role-based dashboards, account recovery, and "Remember Me" login, UTM Mood Tracker offers a personalized and structured approach to mental health tracking in an academic environment.
