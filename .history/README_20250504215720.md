# Introduction to Our Mobile App – UTM Mood Tracker

### Developed by Team Upholders, the UTM Mood Tracker is a mobile application designed to support the emotional wellbeing of the UTM community. This app provides a secure and user-friendly platform for students to log their moods, reflect on their mental health, and gain meaningful insights over time.

## The system supports three key user roles:

### 1. Students, who track their moods and journal their thoughts

### 2. Therapists, who can access student mood data with consent for better guidance

### 3. Admins, who manage user access and oversee system integrity

### With features like voice-based journaling, role-based dashboards, account recovery, and "Remember Me" login, UTM Mood Tracker offers a personalized and structured approach to mental health tracking in an academic environment.
